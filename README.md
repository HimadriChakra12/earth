# Project Earth
##### by `4urora3night`
##### Version: `152.3` — *[Beta]*
A script to install your apps, all housed in a `.toml` file - for rapid and automated arch linux setups. \
Initially inspired by the ML4W options script.

### Requirements
- Arch linux system
- Active WiFi connection

### Usage
You can download the script with:
Clone the repo:

```bash
bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4urora3night/earth/refs/heads/main/downloader.sh")
cd earth
./earth.sh
```


To use the App installer feature, you need a {Name}.toml file containing AUR/pacman and/or flatpak packages.

*Toml*:
```toml
[pacman] 
#Table name = Compulsory
install = ['cava', 'fzf'] 
# List = Fill with package names
[flatpak]
install = ['md.obsidian.Obsidian', 'app.zen_browser.zen']
```

The TOML file can be placed in the level above and _all_ levels below the the Project Earth folder.
For example:
```
📁 Home
∟ 📄 {Your TOML File}.toml
∟ 📁 earth
  ∟ 📄 {Another place your TOML File can live}.toml
  ∟ 📁 lib
    ∟ 📄 {Here also can your TOML File stay}.toml
  ∟ 📄 earth.sh
```
Hidden toml files are allowed
